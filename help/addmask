Help for ADDMASK:

This command adds a mask that will report and optionally k-line
matching masks, or one that is exempt from other masks.

Masks are matched against "nick!user@host gecos" whenever
a user connects or changes nick.

Possible types are:

 - suspicious: matches will be reported in the report channel
 - lethal: matches will be reported and k-lined
 - exempt: matches are exempt from other types of mask

You can use characters other than / to delimit the mask.

Syntax: ADDMASK /<regex>/[i] <type> [~<duration>]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ADDMASK /^spambot\d+/i lethal
    /msg &nick& ADDMASK / .*notalogbot/ suspicious ~30m
    /msg &nick& ADDMASK #@freenode/staff/.* # exempt
